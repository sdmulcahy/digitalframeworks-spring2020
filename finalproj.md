# 'A hell hole': Chronic understaffing in nursing homes paved way for covid-19 outbreaks 
*By: Shawn Mulcahy* | June 9, 2020

Brian Jones stood outside a Connecticut nursing home in early April, the warm, afternoon sun beating down. He and his family peered through the window as a nurse wheeled over his mother’s wheelchair. Jones, 59, prepared to say a final goodbye.

A day earlier, a nurse at Kimberly Hall North had called to tell Jones his 79-year-old mother’s condition had worsened. She lost her appetite and her fever reached 103 degrees. Jones hadn’t seen his mother in more than a month since the facility closed its doors to visitors in March to mitigate the spread of the novel coronavirus. 

On April 13, she passed away.

“That place is a hell hole,” Jones said. “I don’t think the nurses had a clue what they were dealing with.”

Kimberly Hall North, like thousands of nursing homes across the country, faced a widespread covid-19 outbreak. Years of lobbying against regulations and a drive to increase profitability left many facilities understaffed and ill-equipped to handle the pandemic.

Health care industry groups have for years leveraged strong political might to fight off stricter regulations on Capitol Hill and in statehouses nationwide. 

Legislation to require mandatory staffing levels for nursing homes have been proposed—and failed—nearly every year since the groundbreaking Nursing Home Reform Act was passed in 1987.  In March, as the coronavirus was beginning to make its way through nursing homes, President Trump relaxed federal rules mandating infection control experts in every facility.

Despite repeated calls for more robust regulations on the number of nurses in homes, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid services, which oversees the facilities, has left the original 1987 statute untouched. The law simply requires that a skilled nursing facility provide 24-hour nursing care which is “sufficient to meet the needs of each resident.”

Advocates say that leaves nursing homes vulnerable and unprepared to handle major crises, such as the covid-19 pandemic. Charlene Harrington, a nursing home expert and professor emeritus at the University of California San Francisco, said even CMS’s suggested staffing levels fall far below expert recommendations.

Nursing homes face extraordinarily high staff turnover, especially among nursing aides who earn minimum wage and lack health insurance or paid sick leave. The median salary for a certified nursing aide is just $19,000, according to a 2017 report by PHI, a long-term care advocacy organization.

“They don’t want people that have a lot of seniority,” Harrington said. “They don’t care if they burn through staff.”

Research directly links the quality of a nursing home to its staffing levels. A 2012 study found poor nursing home quality is directly linked to inadequate staffing levels. In facilities with fewer nurses on staff, residents were more likely to suffer from pressure ulcers and higher mortality rates. These homes were also more likely to be cited by CMS for deficiencies in quality of care.

Infections are a leading cause of hospitalization and death in nursing homes, according to a report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nearly 380,000 people die each year from infections in long-term care facilities.

But the health care industry has spent millions of dollars over the last 30 years to fight off proposed reforms. The industry, backed by powerful trade associations including the American Health Care Association/National Center for Assisted Living and LeadingAge, has cultivated deep ties to the federal government, often employing former government officials tasked with lobbying the agencies they previously represented.

Among lobbyists for AHCA/NCAL, for example, are a senior staff member of the U.S. House Health Appropriations Subcommittee, a senior aide to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and a former U.S. congressman, disclosure reports show.

U.S. Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Illinois, has introduced a number of nursing home-related measures, most recently last November with the Quality Care for Nursing Home Residents Act of 2019. That bill has so far not yet received a single hearing.

“Putting a loved one in a nursing facility is always a difficult decision,” Schakowsky said in a statement. “We must ensure nursing home residents are not harmed because of deficiencies in the facilities they rely on to survive.”

Some states have sought to impose mandatory staffing ratios in place of the federal government. 

California—the only state with a law mandating staffing ratios—passed increased staffing standards in 2018 that required skilled nursing facilities to provide at least 3.5 hours of direct care per resident per day, an increase from the 3.2 under previous law. That is still far below the expert recommended 4.2 hours, and the majority of the state’s homes have filed waivers with the health department.

A similar effort is underway in Illinois, where industry groups have railed against the efforts. Mandated ratios are a “one-size-fits-all approach” that ignores “the reality of existing staffing mandates and practices, as well as our current workforce crisis,” wrote the Illinois Hospital Association in a memo opposing the proposal.

LeadingAge, a trade organization that represents 5,000 long-term care organizations, plays an active role in fighting back state-level reform, with its network of 38 affiliates across 43 states. 

The majority of the country’s nursing homes are for profit, according to federal data. A number of studies have linked ownership type to quality of care, where for-profit facilities are more likely to provide worse care than the nonprofit or government-owned counterparts. 

Toby Edelman, a senior policy attorney at Center for Medicare Advocacy, said nonprofit nursing faculties, not bound by generating revenue, are more likely to invest in greater staffing and resources, while for-profit homes often “skimp” on these services. 

The four largest nursing home chains are all privately owned corporations. In total, for-profit nursing homes account for 70% of the nation’s 15,500 facilities.

In Connecticut, Gov. Ned Lamont recently announced a third-party investigation into how nursing homes have responded to covid-19, including understaffing. 

But to Jones, whose mother died in Kimberly Hall North, the action comes too late.

“They don’t live in it. They don’t deal with it. They don’t see it,” Jones said. “It’s not on their agenda to care about people in convalescent homes.”
