# Cannabis industry lobbying

Public support for receational and medical marijuana has surged to record highs. And, unsurprisingly, the rapidly growing industry is increasingly spending to influence the federal government. I'd like to track federal lobbying efforts to determine what issues are important to the industry and which entities are expanding thier influence.

Here are the data points I'll be collecting:

* The entity's name
* The lobbyist employed
* The federal filing period
* The issues lobbyied on
* The amount the entity spent on lobbying

I will pull the data from quarterly federal lobbyist disclosures complied and [published online](https://lobbyingdisclosure.house.gov/) by the U.S. House of Representatives.

| Client Name | Lobbyist name | Filing period | Issues | Reported amount|
|-------------|---------------|---------------|--------|----------------|
| Greenwich Biosciences, Inc. | Walter, Deborah | 1st Quarter Report | [{"name":"HCR","description":"HEALTH ISSUES","active":true}] | 490000 |
