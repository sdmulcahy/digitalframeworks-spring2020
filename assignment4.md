# Assignment 4: Story Pitch

The novel coronavirus epidemic is taking a particularly harsh toll on an already vulnerable population: nursing home residents. Across the county, the virus has ravaged nursing homes, with ten of thousands of residents and staff infected and thousands more dead.

I'd like to track the magnitude of the outbreak. This can largely be done using data from state health departments and the federal government. Most states have released either a list of affected facilites or general data on the scale of the outbreak.

I'll get perspectives from nursing home advocates and academic experts, as well as reaction from industry groups, such as the National Health Care Association.

There are number of elements in the story that would make for fascinating visualizations. First, I could build a U.S. map showing the number of outbreaks in each state or county, depending on data availability. The map could be updated in real-time. I could also build a chart that shows how cases of covid-19 have grown in nursing homes.
