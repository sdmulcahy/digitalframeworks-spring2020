# Assignment 1 â€“ Final Story Ideas

## Cannabis campaign finance
Support for recreational cannabis has surged over the past few years, and the drug is now legal in some form in 37 states. As companies expand and grow, so too does their political clout. A number of leading cannabis companies have increasingly turned to the federal government to push for reforms such as the SAFE Banking Act and the STATES Act.

I would like to track the growing influence of cannabis companies on federal regulators and lawmakers, using data from Congressional lobbying disclosure reports and federal campaign finance reports.

### Objective: Clarity and accuracy
* Were you able to immediately identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate? 5
  * The story focuses on how much cannabis companies spend on lobbying Congress, and how it has failed to motivate lawmakers to move forward with marijuana reform.
  * Yes, the central idea was in the headline.
* Were you able to quickly understand how you would navigate the data? 3
  * The reporter tracked cannabis lobbying expenses and how cannabis-related bills fared in Congress.
  * I would put the data higher up in the story.
* Using your own knowledge and critical thinking abilities, do you think the data was accurate? 4
  * The reporter didn't speak with the leading cannabis industry association, cannabis businesses or banking groups.
  * The reporter did provide a source.
  * The reporter did explain everything that needed explaining.
### Objective: Quality
* Regardless of the form that the graphic/story takes, was it executed at a high degree of quality? 4
  * The story does a fantastic job of bringing in prosepective from political insiders, but I would've also liked to hear from those in the industry. It seems disingenuous to downplay the industry's success without including their perspective.
* Consider some tasks a data story must do well:
  * The story could've used stronger graphics, such as illustrating how much was spent.
  * The reporter used data as a launching point, drawing in first-person perspectives and veryifying the data was correct.
### Objective: Type and Color
* Considering color and type use, did this person use type (as in typography, fonts) and color to their best purpose?
  * Type: 4 
    * The type was easy to read. However, it might've made more sense to use subheadings and pull quotes to break up the copy. It was a lot of dense text on a complicated subject.
  * Color: 3
    * The outlet could've done more with the color. For example, siimply changing the pull quote to green or incorporating a grpahic.
 ### Objective: Creativity
 * Did the piece use some creative elements to good effect? As in, to emphasize those areas that could draw someone in, or to add detail where needed, but not just random visual or story junk that distracts you? 3
   * The story could've incorporated more visual elements, even other pictures to break up the copy. I would've also liked to see some sort of data visualization.
   
## Prison telecom contractors
Inmates at U.S. prisons have very little connection to the outside world. The restricted access they do have comes in the form of phone and video calls. These services, provided to inmates and their families for a fee, are often contracted out to private companies.

I would like to look into contracts between telecom companies and state prisons across the U.S. I might also draw on reports filed with the SEC. The goal would be to find out how much money these companies make, and if it disenfranchises or exploits incarcerated individuals.
